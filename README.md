## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MattiasHenders/wedding-template.git
   cd wedding-template
   ```

### Install Dependencies

1. **Install dependencies**

   If you are using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you are using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Set up environment variables**

   The app relies on several environment variables for proper configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AIRTABLE_TOKEN=<your_airtable_token>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AIRTABLE_BASE=<your_airtable_base_id>

   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your_google_maps_api_key>

   NEXT_PUBLIC_FILLOUT_RSVP_ID=<your_fillout_rsvp_id>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FILLOUT_GIFT_ID=<your_fillout_gift_id>

   NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD=<your_password>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_SKIP_PASSWORD=<true_or_false>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders (`<your_variable>`) with your actual API keys and configuration values.

2. **Edit the config files**

   You can find the files [here](./src/config/).

   You will need to edit the following files:
   -**[Admin Config](./src/config/admin.config.ts)**
   -**[Colour/Theme Config](./src/config/colour.config.ts)**
   -**[Wedding Config](./src/config/wedding.config.ts)**

   ```json
   const weddingConfig: WeddingConfigType = {
       people: {
           bride: { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe' },
           groom: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith' }
       },
       date: {
           date: '2026-01-31',
           time: '16:30' // Optional
       },
       location: {
           title: 'Teahouse in Stanley Park',
           address: '7501 Stanley Park Dr, Vancouver, BC V6G 1Z4',
           link: 'https://www.vancouverdine.com/teahouse/',
           latLng: '49.3016707,-123.1597673'
       }
   }
   ```

### Run the App

1. **Run the app**

   After setting up the environment variables, start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
